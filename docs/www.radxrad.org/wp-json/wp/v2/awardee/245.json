While progress has been made on the development of methods and the interpretation of data, much remains to be improved for the technology to be used as a public health management tool. A major drawback in the current approaches are 1) the lack of streamlined and consistent pre-analytical processing steps, 2) coverage across the relevant targets requires a high number of reactions (&gt;20) from any single sample to provide quantitative information, and 3) a lack of vision on the development of a pathogen\/marker panel, much like those used in clinical arenas, for interpretation of the data across different states, regions and nations. The goal of this project will be to successfully navigate these three limitations toward development of a public health warning system that is not dependent on clinical testing and has the ability to rapidly address novel pathogen threats in the future.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"author":2,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"foas":[39],"class_list":["post-245","awardee","type-awardee","status-publish","hentry","foas-wastewater"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee\/245","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/awardee"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee\/245\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2867,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee\/245\/revisions\/2867"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=245"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"foas","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/foas?post=245"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
