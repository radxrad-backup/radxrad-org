In the face of an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and with single-plex qPCR fluorometry inadequate for high throughput clinical diagnostics, the demand for testing exceeds the capacity, leading to limited availability, long queue times, backlogs in COVID-19 diagnoses, and delayed access to specialized treatment for COVID-19 patients.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p>The goal of this RADx funded project is to develop an easily scalable and massively paralleled multiplexed screening method by next generation sequencing (NGS) with sample-specific barcoded indexes to allow pooling of up to 9200 samples.\u00a0 The approach enables detection of SARS-COV-2 viral gRNA content (load) and\u00a0<a name=\"m_-1715499760046465188_x__Hlk54250479\"><\/a>expression profiles;\u00a0detection of host\u2019s transcriptional response to infection simultaneously (expression profile).\u00a0 Transcriptional profiles are analyzed in the context of clinical data (electronic medical records of symptoms, treatments and outcomes) in order to identify and select features (biomarkers) that are predictive of clinical outcome using machine learning methods. These selected biomarkers are then validated in an independent clinical sample. Comparative testing of alternative sample collection (saliva, buccal swab) and handling protocols is ongoing with the goal of matching new protocols with existing SOPs for PCR-based testing in CLIA-certified facilities.<\/p>\r\n<p>\u00a0In addition to increasing testing throughput, this precision medicine approach may provide a very early look at who may be asymptomatic but infectious, or who is about to get very sick. Methods developed during this project may be adaptable to viruses or other pathogens in future pandemics.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"author":2,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"foas":[36],"class_list":["post-378","awardee","type-awardee","status-publish","hentry","foas-other"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee\/378","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/awardee"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee\/378\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2539,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee\/378\/revisions\/2539"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=378"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"foas","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/foas?post=378"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
