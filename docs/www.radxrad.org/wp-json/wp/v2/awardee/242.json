This NIH funded WE-REACH Center is a National Center of REACH in the Northwest region. Two key objectives of the Center are to (1) assist investigators with innovative technologies to establish proof-of-product concept definition (2) facilitating the formation of spinout companies on track to a self-sustaining structure. With well-established expertise, know-how and infrastructure to assist the Research and Development of the following two Covid-19 technical- ready Covid-19 research and develop projects intended to verify proof-of-product concepts with working prototype. (1) Aptamer-based highly sensitive biosensors for salivary COVID-19 antigen detection (Pun) (2) Broad-spectrum detection of VOC and non-VOC biomarkers from patient exhalant using biomimetic multiplexed eNose biosensor for COVID-19 diagnosis (Saikaya) The two technically sound approaches employ by the point-of-care device candidates intend to detect viral antigen in saliva and exhalant biomarker signatures from infected subjects without having to send sample to a centralized facility or a long wait-time for results. WE-REACH will assist the investigators in developing milestone-driven, stage-gated, activity-based project planning and tracking to accelerate proof-of-product concept studies within 2-year of funding. The study results will provide measurable outcomes that are deemed sufficient for upscaling and appropriate for follow-on funding.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"author":2,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"foas":[38],"class_list":["post-242","awardee","type-awardee","status-publish","hentry","foas-novel-biosensing-and-voc"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee\/242","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/awardee"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee\/242\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1968,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee\/242\/revisions\/1968"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=242"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"foas","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/foas?post=242"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
