The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) represents the most important method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at its early stage of infection and before the appearance of clinical symptoms. However, qPCR-based molecular diagnostics are bulky, expensive, or lab-based, or require trained personnel for system operation. The majority of the FDA EUA-approved COVID diagnostics are PCR-based which require nucleic acid extraction and amplification and thermal cycling. Such systems also require relatively expensive\/bulky equipment for sample processing. Recent studies have shown large variations up to 10,000 fold variations in limit of detection (LoD) of some of the nucleic acid-based and antigenbased COVID-19 diagnostics currently approved under emergency use authorization (EUA). Therefore, there is still a need in developing POC diagnostics and particularly antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 detection devices with LoD comparable to PCR-based assays. The main goal of this interdisciplinary project is developing a portable diagnostic system for rapid (&lt;30 minutes) and sensitive (LoD=100 &#8211; 1000 copies\/ml) detection of intact SARS-CoV-2 in small volume (&lt;100 \u03bcL) of COVID-19 patient samples such as nasopharyngeal\/oropharyngeal swab and saliva\/sputum samples using an inexpensive (&lt;$5 material cost), disposable, and mass-producible microfluidic cartridge.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"author":2,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"foas":[38],"class_list":["post-382","awardee","type-awardee","status-publish","hentry","foas-novel-biosensing-and-voc"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee\/382","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/awardee"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee\/382\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1955,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/awardee\/382\/revisions\/1955"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=382"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"foas","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.radxrad.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/foas?post=382"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
