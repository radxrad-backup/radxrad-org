					<description><![CDATA[Abstract Text: The breakneck spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has exposed the soft underbelly of modern infectious disease diagnostics – a system highly reliant on PCR-based diagnosis. In this pandemic, the system has been rapidly overwhelmed, as it was in the 2009 pandemic flu and the 2014-6 Ebola outbreak. Other approaches for the detection&#8230;]]></description>
